Selenium Hybrid Framework
(Python, Selenium, PyTest, Page Object Model, HTML Reports)
----------------------------
1)  what is framework?
ans->framework is an organized way of maintaining automation files.
     In the framework all the files will communicate each other to perform
     certain task.

 Objectives/Goals
 --------------------------
 1) Re-use ability
 2) maintainability

Types of framework:
---------------------------
1)Built in framework
    PyTest, RobotFramework(keyword driven framework used internally), unittest etc...
2)Customized/User defined framework
    DataDriven Framework, Keyword driven framework, Hybrid Driven framework(most popular)

phases
-------
1)Analyse application, technology and skill set of team, choose test cases

interview question
------------------
ques: suppose u have 100 manual test cases and how your choosing test cases to auto mate
-----
ans: automation in the market because of overcoming the challenge of retesting and regression testing.

1)first priority
re-test cases(test the data(data driven testcases)
Ex: some test cases needs some data and again again need to test with multiple sets of data.

2)Regression Testing
EX: some test cases need to execute in multiple phase but make sure existing functionality should not break

3)Apart from this
other test cases can be automatable

ques: what is 100% automation means or 100% automation is poosible???
-----
ans: 100% automation is not all possible

some test cases cannot be automatable which are they
1)security violations scenario testcases
2)Reports
3)captures

Note:
-----
Test cases which can be automatable all the test cases then that comes under 100% automation

ques: Design and implementation of framework.
-----

ques: Execution
-----

ques: Maintanance(version control system)

Doing project on eCommerce Application:
---------------------------------------
FrontEnd Application
Backend Application(Designing the framework we are using back end part
                    most important)

what is your contributions to projects
--------------------------------------
1)what your done in automation perspective
ans:
-----
have you created page of the classes
have you created test cases
have you created utility files

test data can be two types:
---------------------------
1)random data(generate the data at run time through our random scripts)
2)static data(prepare the test data before itself and we can keep in excel file)
3)dynamic data
